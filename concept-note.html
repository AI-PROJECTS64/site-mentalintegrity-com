      <h2>From data protection to protection of the mind</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Over the 2025–2035 horizon, the governance of <b>data, AI and
        neurotechnology</b> is converging towards a central question: how to protect
        the integrity of the human mind itself. Classical notions of privacy and
        data protection remain essential, but they are no longer sufficient when
        technologies can both <b>read from</b> and <b>write to</b> the brain and
        mental states.
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Neurotechnology</b> — brain–computer interfaces, neuro-imaging,
          neuromodulation and consumer EEG devices measure and sometimes
          modulate neural activity beyond strictly medical contexts.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>AI-driven influence</b> — recommender systems, immersive media,
          generative content and targeted advertising shape what people see, feel

        <div class="chip">
          <b>Fundamental rights</b> — freedom of thought, dignity, physical and

          new capabilities.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        In this landscape, <b>mental integrity</b> is emerging as a reference term to
        capture the protection of mental states and processes against harmful
        interference, beyond the sole question of data disclosure.

      <div class="section-tag">2. From privacy to mental integrity</div>
      <h2>Why classical privacy concepts are not enough</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Traditional data protection regimes focus on <b>information</b>: what is
        collected, how it is processed, who has access, under which legal basis.
        Neurotechnology and AI-mediated environments raise additional concerns:
        they can alter how individuals <b>perceive</b>, <b>evaluate</b> and
        <b>decide</b>, sometimes in ways that are not experienced as external
        interference.
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Mental privacy</b> addresses access to thoughts, emotions and intentions
          — for example via neuro-data or fine-grained behavioural signals.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Cognitive liberty</b> emphasises the freedom to choose whether, how and
          when to use neurotechnologies or cognitive enhancement tools.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Psychological continuity</b> focuses on the preservation of identity and

          personality or affect.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        <b>Mental integrity</b> can be understood as the umbrella that connects these
        notions: it protects individuals against <b>harmful interference with their
        mental states and processes</b>, whether through invasive neurotechnology,
        pervasive AI-driven environments or combined systems.

    <!-- 3. EMERGING NEURO-RIGHTS LANDSCAPE -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">3. Emerging neuro-rights landscape</div>
      <h2>Constitutions, courts and ethical frameworks</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The idea of protecting mental integrity is no longer limited to academic
        debate. Over the last years, several developments have signalled its
        consolidation as a legal and policy category:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Constitutional and legislative reforms</b> have begun to reference
          neuro-data and mental integrity explicitly, positioning neurorights as a
          new frontier of human-rights protection.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Regional and international bodies</b> examine how existing rights to
          physical and mental integrity and freedom of thought apply to
          neurotechnology and AI-mediated influence.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Ethical frameworks</b> from organisations such as UNESCO and regional
          councils explore global principles for neurotechnology, including the
          protection of mental integrity and mental privacy.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Academic and policy literature</b> now treats mental integrity as a
          distinct concern, requiring safeguards against both invasive devices and
          ubiquitous digital environments.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        These developments do not yield a single, uniform definition. They do,
        however, point to a shared intuition: the human mind deserves specific
        protections when technologies can access, infer or alter its contents and
        dynamics.

    <!-- 4. THREAT SCENARIOS 2030 -->

      <div class="section-tag">4. Threat scenarios (2030 horizon)</div>
      <h2>Where mental integrity could be at risk</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The following scenarios are <b>illustrative only</b>. They do not describe
        actual products or actors, but highlight categories of risk that decision
        makers may wish to consider when articulating mental-integrity safeguards.
      </p>

      <h3>4.1 Consumer BCI and attention harvesting</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          Low-friction EEG headsets used for gaming, productivity or wellness
          collect neuro-data that can reveal patterns of attention, fatigue or
          emotional response.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Combining these signals with recommender systems or targeted advertising
          could enable <b>closed-loop optimisation</b> of engagement, raising
          questions about manipulation and consent.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>4.2 Neuro-enhancement in the workplace</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          Employers may experiment with neurofeedback or neuromodulation tools to
          improve focus, reduce stress or monitor fatigue.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Power asymmetries and implicit pressure to participate may threaten
          autonomy and mental integrity, even if participation appears “voluntary”.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>4.3 State-level surveillance and coercion</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          In some contexts, neurotechnology and pervasive sensing could be used to
          deepen existing surveillance architectures.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          The risk is not limited to reading mental states; it also concerns
          <b>structuring information environments</b> in ways that undermine
          freedom of thought and pluralism.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>4.4 Emotionally targeted manipulation</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          AI-generated content and immersive media tailored to emotional profiles
          may be used to steer beliefs, attitudes or voting behaviour.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          When combined with neuro- or bio-signals, such systems can blur the line
          between persuasion and <b>non-consensual mental interference</b>.
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="muted">
        These scenarios do not imply that neurotechnology or AI are undesirable.
        They illustrate why <b>mental integrity</b> can serve as a guiding notion to
        assess risks and design proportionate safeguards.
